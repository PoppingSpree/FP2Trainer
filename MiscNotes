should probably do some kind of enum flag thing like with the inputs to reduce data throughput for sending these commands over net.

CMD_NETID|connectionID|displayName|charID [example -> ]1111_1111|4|"coryfan34"|1]
step|CMD_SPAWN|
step|CMD_HURT|dmg (or new health val)
step|CMD_HEAL|dmg (or new health val)
step|CMD_SCENE|SceneName
step|CMD_SYNC|timeOffset
step|posrot|1.0f|1.0f,|1.0f|0|0|0|0


Remember to patch around RestorePlayerInput
------------

// Snippet used to do a loop across all objects of a type. For example, every object checking against a spring.
while (FPStage.ForEach(FPPlayer.classID, objRef))



MonoBehaviors

FPBaseObject: Every active FP game object is based on this. Player, Enemy, Boss, or otherwise. Because of this, if you can achieve everything you need with this type, you can downcast those other types and use this.
FPPlayer: Handles implemention of character actions and state machines.
FPStage: Basically the "director" of gameplay, it controls the camera, it keeps track of the player, bosses, game state and is responsible for calling for most save/load data.
PlayerSpawnPoint: Has all the properties for spawning in a player after the FPStage starts, as well as setting debug mode flags for the character and the position the character will be placed at.

Stage Setup: This is the Game Object that will contain the FPStage script and is necessary for stages to function.

	{
		Gizmos.color = new Color(0f, 0f, 0f, 0.25f);

If "pf" is at the front of a name, it's probably short for "Prefab". Feel free to copy these references.

a 12 frame windup on actions gives plenty of room for network communication while still looking kinda convincing... but might not work for FP.

/*
if (value.StartsWith("Shift+"))

    value = value.Substring(6);

checkModifiersForKeys // probablyh wanna pass in true

fppausemenu 
this is the bit where it reacts to the chosen option:

else if (FPStage.menuInput.confirm)
				{
					timer = 0f;
					switch (menuSelection)

menuCursor
----

public FPObjectState inputMethod;
// In FPEventSequence
targetPlayer.inputMethod = targetPlayer.GetInputFromPlayer1;

public static List<FPPlayer> FindFPPlayers(bool includeInactivePlayers)
